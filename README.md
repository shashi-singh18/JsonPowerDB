 **Description**
 

 - In this project, we created a vertical(basic) form where we have three rows for *Employee ID, Employee Name *and* Email.*
 - We have used different functions like *saveEmployee(), validateAndGetFormData() *and* resetForm()* to create a schema and fill the data inside.
 - With the help of [login2explore-resources ](https://login2explore.com/jpdb/resources/js/0.0.3/jpdb-commons.js), we don't have to write *createPUTRequest() *and* executeCommand()* separately.
